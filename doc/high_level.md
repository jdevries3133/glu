Slogan: Glu is for all things edu

Pitch: Glu strives to replace SIS with SaaS. Gone are the days of lock-in with
antiquated, broken, and feature-dry platforms. Glu is a flexible, extensible,
open source student information system with the building blocks to replace any
establoshment SIS, and the collaboration tools to empower schools to put them
together.

# Business Plan

## Background

There is demand for a re-imagining of technology in our schools. Teachers are
more tech literate than ever before, and as generational changes naturally
proceed that only becomes more true. Furthermore, there's a massive drive in
schools to increase teaching and learning around tech because parents want
their children to have the opportunity for class mobility (or even stability)
that, increasingly, only tech seems to provide. Parents want tech in all
aspects of the curricula, from math to ELA to music class. 

As parents, teachers, and students meet new peaks of tech literacy, their
demands clash with ith the status quo. SIS software, which sits at the heart of
K-12 IT operations is old, unmaintained, inflexible, undocumented, proprietary,
and generally shit. Schools can't escape it because it's generally a
requirement for state reporting requirements, but this "crud at the center" IT
architecture at every school locks them into software mediocrity. Meanwhile,
adjacent ecosystem has flourished. Google classroom, quizziz, edpuzzle, Kahoot,
and scores of other learning platforms provide delightful and engaging tools
for students, teachers, AND parents, but they always place the burden on the
teacher to move all that data into the core SIS for report cards, and all that
data never gets meaningfully aggregated for internal or external users.
Research has demonstrated that data driven learning has meaningful impacts on
students, but we are throwing away enormous insights that would unlock human
potential. The onus can't be on teachers to become data scientists, too, but a
technology platform could provide individual insights at scale.

Technology improvements also create new opportunities. Low code technology is
improving. The maturation of python and JavaScript make light scripting for the
masses more approachable than ever before, and everyone wants in. GPT provides
a crutch for programming that might be just enough for newcomers to move fast
enough for it to be worthwhile to them. A tool that is scriptable at multiple
levels of abstraction, and gives everyone access to version controlled
workflows that they can collaborate on can work in today's technology
environment, in ways that it didn't work before. 

## Value Proposition

Glu will solve an array of very real and _very_ painful problems for all
educational stakeholders: parents, teachers, students, and school leaders.
Problems we are taking on include:

- allowing schools to collaboratively develop data pipelines that suit their
  needs
- providing high visibility to parents, school leaders, and public policy
  makers
- providing a programmable, extensible, low-code/no-code, version controlled,
  and collaborative interface to everyone
  - teachers, so they don't need to do as much data processing work
  - students, so they can step up as leaders and apply learning to develop cool
    things
  - school leaders, so they can build data pipelines for their schools and
    satisfy reporting standards
  - developers, so that they can pitch into their communities and meaningfully
    support schools through 3rd party workflows and other integrations

Although Glu SIS as described above will be free and open source, we intend to
leverage it to meaningfully tackle the huge problems in education, which will
provide outsized value:

- building trust between schools and communities
- raising the educational attainment of everyone
- replacing low-granularity standardized testing with high-granularity
  benchmarks that can be designed by anyone and deployed in an agile fashion
- improving student discipline through flexible frameworks that meet the needs
  of every community
- diminishing the role of hate and division in our society through knowledge

In the end, we expect that our technology will be such a fundamental driver of
improvements in K-12 education that it would be neglectful for members of
learning communities not to engage with it.

Although it's easy to identify many short-term monetization strategies for a
project like this, we expect that investors will recognize that the
long-term value that this project will unlock has almost unbounded real
economic value. Our organization's mission is to only take a piece out of that
pie to the extent that it empowers us to grow, and ensures the stability of the
platform.

# Glu MVP

## Idea to Validate

`gludo` will be the main value software we're trying to develop. It'll be the
core low/no/full programmable platform. This feels like our main value item
and the "tech" of our platform.

glu SIS will have a 1st party integration with Google classroom, it'll
basically appear like a Google classroom extension at first

It'll have workflows, though, and school leaders will see that they can
legitimately replace their SIS if they just use it for state reporting and
other basic use cases.
